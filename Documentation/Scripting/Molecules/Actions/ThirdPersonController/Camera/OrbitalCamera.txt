OrbitalCamera -- Class derived from MonoBehaviour

Action component including a variant of a basic orbit-type camera control for 3rd person perpectives. This variant checks for a zooming state to control sensitivity. The behavior is based on a setup in the scene hierarchy where the camera is a child to the pivot. That allows to easily set offsets in the scene while keeping the code size down. The target is also customizable, allowing panning or more offset types.

    [String] verticalAxis -- Axis name from the input manager to be used for the vertical movement.
