Framework of semi component-based scripts for Unity

This repository will potentially grow and change over time based on my work for various projects. My current take on design in Unity is to use an hybrid approach between purely component-based and purely scripted data/logic. A problem is recursively broken down into simpler bits until a limitation from the Unity engine or editor is hit (requiring the making of general purpose systems). Not having enough time and knowledge to tackle these limitations properly, this hybrid approach is the best compromise I found until more appropriate tools show up.
